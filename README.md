# `@foo-software/react-feature-toggle`

A feature toggle for React. Feature toggles (otherwise known as feature flags or feature switches) are a software development technique that provides a way of turning functionality or display on and off during runtime, without deploying new code. This allows for more control and experimentation over the full lifecycle of features. Feature toggles are a best practice in DevOps, often occurring within distributed version control systems.
